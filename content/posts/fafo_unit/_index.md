The motto of this unit is pretty simple: "Fuck Around, Find Out". Sometimes our
researchers find something really fascinating to the point of not being able to
focus on the task at hand. We've decided to allow them to follow their whims.
At the HEKAR Institute we believe that there are no side projects.

We started regrouping those individuals and soon after the F.A.F.O. Unit was created.
It's composed of our wildest explorators willing to go anywhere to find anything.
And sometimes, if we're lucky, they even come back on track.

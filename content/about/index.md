prizes for its numerous findings in fields where the HRC is most proficient. Here
are some quotes from pretigious people that were impressed with the HRC accomplishments:

> "Nope, never heard of it."

> -- Greatest mind of our time, Aiyam Kallin the Paulice

## Our goals

At the HRC, we strive to further research in the realm of computer music. We are always innovating and never
shy away from a challenge. One of our greatest achievment, after years of extensive experimentation,
is the discovery of the inability for computer to learn to sing even after going through the most
intensive music curriculum imaginable.

For the foreseeable future, the HRC will continue its effort to make the perfect singing computer.
We will do anything that's in our power to offer the opportunity for these machine to be the lead
in a Broadway musical -- that is, unless it involves long and arduous mathematical proofs.
